Race Results: "46th Annual Pumpkin Run by Senior Coastsiders October 20, 2024"
https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/4du2ec7ndnu4mtt5/results

Scraping table:
// copied JS Selector from devtools for table selector
let table = document.querySelector("#radix-\\:r7\\:-content-results > div > div > div.w-100.overflow-auto > table");
let rows = Array.from(table.querySelectorAll('tr')).slice(1);

for (row of rows) {
    row_elements = Array.from(row.children).slice(0,12).map(r => r.textContent.trim());
    console.log( row_elements.join(",") );
}

very crude, then just saved the console text output and cleaned it

plotly.js ?
or go raw and use d3.js .... really want it to look pretty, but plotly has convenient functions



https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database | seems like a convenient tutorial, it says dashboard-app lol
seems like vercel has a thing for me to create a database... and should be easy to integrate, but can theoritically use any other database ig?
Vercel Postgres Storage... First 256 MB free
but I can't write to it?? not sure what Vercel Postgres Written Data is


Prisma ORM?
https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/using-an-orm#prisma
need to seed the DB, not sure how

https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/postgres-prisma

I don't want a whole nextjs app just to do the initial seeding
should just be a simple script that reads my csv and uploads

ykw, build errors were probably caused by me using npx, should be using pnpm dlx or pnpm exec instead (npx technically also deprecated? should be npm exec? idk man)
deleted node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm dlx prisma generate

wait.... my local node_modules shouldn't affect the vercel deployment.... ugh....

deleted pnpm-lock.yaml and ran pnpm install again
