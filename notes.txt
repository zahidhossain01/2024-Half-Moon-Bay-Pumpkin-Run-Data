Race Results: "46th Annual Pumpkin Run by Senior Coastsiders October 20, 2024"
https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/4du2ec7ndnu4mtt5/results

Scraping table:
// copied JS Selector from devtools for table selector
let table = document.querySelector("#radix-\\:r7\\:-content-results > div > div > div.w-100.overflow-auto > table");
let rows = Array.from(table.querySelectorAll('tr')).slice(1);

for (row of rows) {
    row_elements = Array.from(row.children).slice(0,12).map(r => r.textContent.trim());
    console.log( row_elements.join(",") );
}

very crude, then just saved the console text output and cleaned it


race results site has an api actually..... could just read from that......

row children
0 - race place
1 - bib number
2 - full name
3 - gender
4 - age
5 - city
6 - state
7 - chip elapsed time
8 - gender place
9 - age group
10 - age place
11 - overall pace

race_place,bib_number,full_name,gender,age,city,state,chip_elapsed_time,gender_place,age_group, age_place, overall_pace

line 241 in half_marathon log doesn't have a race place... 
some runners don't have a chip_elapsed_time, maybe they were absent from the race?


do I actually want to merge all the datasets into one?

so....
plot ideas

% of runners in each city - plot on openstreetmap
same with age group
gender

for the 10k
chip_elapsed_time
overall_pace
plot same for 5k separately
but would also be interesting to plot 5k and 10k distributions together
should be bimodal

gender, but also age group vs age
bc technically age group contains gender info too... | should have a more specific name like gender_age_group, or just group


have a way to lookup bib id or name to see where on graph you are
just pull up stats in gender_place

make some web app type dashboard?

Try plotly's Dash ?
https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial

or go raw and use d3.js ....

curious about hosting as well

next.js
could deploy on vercel
but would python work on vercel?
have to host backend separately then?
idek how vercel fully works

really, I just want a single server to host myself
but Vercel makes stuff super convenient...

Prisma? (postgres?)

https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database | seems like a super convenient tutorial, it says dashboard-app lol
seems like vercel has a thing for me to create a database... and should be easy to integrate, but can theoritically use any other database ig?
Vercel Postgres Storage... First 256 MB free
but I can't write to it?? not sure what Vercel Postgres Written Data is

Prisma ORM can connect to different databases, postgresql / mysql / mongodb / sqlite
