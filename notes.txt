line 241 in half_marathon log doesn't have a race place... 
what will csv parser read that as?


so....
plot ideas

% of runners in each city - plot on openstreetmap
same with age group
gender

for the 10k
chip_elapsed_time
overall_pace
plot same for 5k separately
but would also be interesting to plot 5k and 10k distributions together
should be bimodal


have a way to lookup bib id or name to see where on graph you are
just pull up stats in gender_place

make some web app type dashboard?
